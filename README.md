1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  
  Throughout this course, the focus involved the runtime of the program. The goal was to make the program run as fast and efficiently as possible using the most appropriate data structure for the type of information and processes that were involved for the project.
  

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
  In order to solve this dilemma, I had to figure out which data structure was fastest by analyzing the runtime for different processes like loading the data and printing all of the data sorted out in alphabetical order. Based off the circumstances, I figured that the BST was most appropriate because it possessed the most efficient and reliable runtime. It is essiental to know which data structure to use it can drastically change how the program performs and behaves. In this instance, if I tried using a vector, even though it is simpler and easier to use and implement, it would be very slow in comparison to the BST, and it would also require sorting through the courses manually. 

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I did a lot of research both online and through the resources that were provided throughout the course. For me, it    helps to see articles, videos, or textbooks that have information pertaining to how data structures work. For an even   deeper understanding, I like to see examples demonstrated by other more experienced developers, and I also like to      test and see what works best myself. I feel a combination of all these activities allows me to gain a better insight    into the pros and cons of each data structure, and how certain data structures are better than others depending on the  project.


4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  Instead of approaching a project thoughtlessly, I feel I am able to approach it more methodically. I am more aware of the fact that I have to be thoughtful about what I implement into my program since doing something like using the wrong data structure can seriously hinder the program and the experience that users end up having with it as a result. I'm also thinking more about factors like the program's scalability because I want to keep the program from being memory hungry or from slowing down due to large amounts of data.


5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  When I write programs, I am looking to see what data structure is the most appropriate so that my code remains clean and maintainble. Instead of incorporating my own logic that can make the code more complicated and harder to understand, I can utilize an already established method of digging for data and keep the code maintainable in this way. As a result of using these well-known data structures, they will be easier to read, and the intended purpose of the program will be easier to comprehend. Using the right data structure can also make the program adaptable because it can scale and be expanded on instead of having to rewrite out logic that would make my code more complex.
